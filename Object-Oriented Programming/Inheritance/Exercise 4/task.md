## Inheritance (#1)

Implement a more powerful version of the bomb: the one with a diameter of
the explosion. All the cells that are close enough to the bomb must be destroyed.
The bomb should explode when any mobile element steps into the same cell.

Use the provided auxiliary function `isCloseToBomb()` to check whether
an element is close enough to the bomb to be destroyed.
