## Inheritance (#3)

Create a class `Game` with a property `var result: String`. From `Game`,
inherit `BoardGame`, and from `BoardGame` inherit `Chess`. Give each class an
`init` clause that appends its class name to `result`. Now create a
`BoardGame` object and show the order of initialization of base classes.
