## Inheritance (#2)

Implement a more powerful version of the bomb: the one with a diameter of 
the explosion. All the cells that are close enough to the bomb must be destroyed.
The bomb should explode when any movable element steps to the same cell.

Use the auxiliary function `isCloseToBomb()` to check whether an element
is close enough to the bomb to be destroyed.
