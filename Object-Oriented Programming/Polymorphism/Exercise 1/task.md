## Polymorphism (#1)

The starter code contains the same content as `FantasyGame.kt`. Add an interface
`Flyer` that defines a `fly` method. Then add two new characters:

- `Dragon` who can fly (and implements `Flyer`);
- `Wizard` who can do magic and fly (and implements `Magician` and `Flyer`). 

Uncomment `playTurn()` invocation in `main` and make sure it compiles.
