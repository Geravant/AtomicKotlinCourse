## Interfaces (#3)

Define a property `sound` of type `String` inside the `Pet` interface and
implement it inside classes to return "Bark!" for `Dog`, "Meow!" for `Cat`, and
"Squeak!" for `Hamster`. In `main()`, as in the previous task, create a
`List<Pet>` containing all three types of `Pet`. Iterate through the `List` and
print the value of `sound` for each `Pet`.
