## Upcasting (#2)

Upcasting also happens when you add an object of a derived type into a
container that holds the base type.

The starter code contains an interface `Apple` containing an abstract member 
function `consume`. From `Apple`, inherit `GrannySmith`, `Gala`, `Fuji` and
`Braeburn`. Override `consume()` so, respectively, they return 
`chomp GrannySmith`, `bite Gala`, `press Fuji` and `peel Braeburn`.

`main()` makes a `List<Apple>` and populates it with the specific types of
`Apple`. Make sure you can iterate through the list printing the result of
`consume()` for each object.
