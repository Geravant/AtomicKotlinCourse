## Objects (#2)

Add more nesting to `ObjectNesting.kt`. Inside both the `Nested` objects, add
another `Nested` object that looks the same as its enclosing `Nested`, with the
same name and property, and an appropriate `String` for `a`. The code in
`main()` provides tests. Notice how the namespaces work.
