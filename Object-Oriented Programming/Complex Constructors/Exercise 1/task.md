## Complex Constructors (#1)

Add the primary constructor that initializes a maze contents using 
the maze representation in a string.
Use the auxiliary function `createGameElement()` (defined in `GameElements.kt`)
to create an element by using a given character.

For a start, you can reuse the implementation given in the atom text.
Note, however, that only one element is stored in a cell there, and in a real
game several elements can be stored in one cell. Also, the maze representation
with empty cells at the end of lines isn't supported in the implementation
in the book. Fix this problem.
