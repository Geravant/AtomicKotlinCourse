## Inheritance & Extensions (#2)

Refactor `BatteryPet2.kt` to improve the design:

-   In `Pet`, add an open function `settle()` which calls `trace("")`

-   In `Pet`, add an open function `feed()` which calls `energy.replenish()`

-   In `Dog`, override `settle()` to call `trace("Sitting...")

-   You no longer need `Dog.sit()`

-   Change `playWithDog(dog: Dog)` to `playWithPet(pet: Pet)`

-   Add a `CatFood` type of `Energy`, and define the associated `Cat` class

-   In `main()`, test all types of `Pet`
