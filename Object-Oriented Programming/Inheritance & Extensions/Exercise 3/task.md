## Inheritance & Extensions (#3)

Starting with `Adapter.kt` and `ComposeAdapter.kt`, create a function which
dynamically adapts an object, accepting a `MyClass` and returning a
`MyClassAdaptedForLib`. Is it possible to use the inheritance approach in
`Adapter.kt`, or are you forced to use composition? (We revisit this issue
in [Class Delegation]).
