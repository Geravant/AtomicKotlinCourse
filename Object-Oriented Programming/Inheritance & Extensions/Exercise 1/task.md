## Inheritance & Extensions (#1)

Following `AdjustTemp.kt`, add two extension functions `openWindow()` and
`fan()` as ways of cooling. Add a class `DeltaTemperature2` where the extension
functions are instead member functions, and an overloaded `adjust()` function
which takes a `DeltaTemperature2`. Which approach seems better, or are they
about the same?
