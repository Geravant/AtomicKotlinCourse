## Inheritance & Extensions (#1)

Starting with `TemperatureDelta.kt`, add two extension functions `openWindow()`
and `fan()` as cooling strategies. Add a class `TemperatureDelta2`, but use
member functions instead of extension functions. Add an overloaded `adjust()`
function that takes a `TemperatureDelta2`. Which approach is better, or do they
seem about the same?
