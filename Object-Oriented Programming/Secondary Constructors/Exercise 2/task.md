## Secondary Constructors (#2)

Create a `SpaceShip` class with a `val` class argument of `name: String`. Add
properties `shipClass` (a `String`) and `weight` (an `Int`). Create a
secondary constructor that takes an argument to initialize `shipClass`, and
another secondary constructor that takes arguments to initialize both
`shipClass` and `weight`.
