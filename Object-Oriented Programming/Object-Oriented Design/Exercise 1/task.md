## Object-Oriented Design (#1)

Add new type of `Actor` called `Bomb`, with `*` as its `symbol`. When it
encounters a `Bomb`, the `Robot` loses all its energy and the `Bomb` disappears
from the room (so the `Robot` still enters the room where the `Bomb` was). Add
one or more `*` to `stringMaze` to test your solution.
