## Nullable Types (#2)

Write a function called `zilch()` which takes no arguments, has a function
return type of `String`, and returns `null`. Write a second function `zilch2()`
which returns the result of calling `zilch()`, and also has an explicit return
type.

In `main()`, call `zilch()` and assign the result to a `var` which you
explicitly type. Do the same for `zilch2()`. What must you do in order to get
this code to compile?
