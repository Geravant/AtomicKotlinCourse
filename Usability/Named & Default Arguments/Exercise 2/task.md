## Named & Default Arguments (#1)

Define a class `SimpleTime` that stores the time passed from the beginning 
of the day. 
It should take four arguments: hours, minutes, seconds and nanoseconds,
where each argument has the default value of zero.

Implement two member functions: `toSecondOfDay` and `toNanoOfDay`
returning the number of seconds and nanoseconds accordingly 
passed from the beginning of the day.
