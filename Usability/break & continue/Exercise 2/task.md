## `break` & `continue` (#2)

{{ UNTESTABLE: There's no expected output which can be tested }}

In `main()`, write a labeled `for` loop that counts down from six to zero,
using `label1` as the name of the loop. If the loop counter is four,
`continue`. If it's two, `break`. Place calls to `trace()` from the previous
exercise to ensure that the behavior is what you expect. See what happens if
you remove the labels from `break` and `continue`.
