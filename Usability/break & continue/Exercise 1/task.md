## `break` & `continue` (#1)

Implement a function `readNumbers()` that reads user input in an infinite loop.
When the user enters zero, it `break`s from the loop and displays the sum of
the entered numbers. If the user enters a non-number, it displays "Not a
number: $input" and goes back to accepting input.
