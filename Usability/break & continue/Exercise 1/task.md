## `break` & `continue` (#1)

Write a function `trace(val id: Int)` that displays its argument.

In `main()`, write an infinite loop using `while(true)`. Call `trace(1)` before
entering the infinite loop and `trace(2)` right after entering. Next call
break, and `trace(3)` after the close of the infinite loop.
