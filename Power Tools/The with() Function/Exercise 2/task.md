## The `with()` Function (#2)

To better understand the difference between an ordinary lambda and a lambda
with receiver, implement the toy `with2()` function which takes an ordinary
lambda as a parameter instead of a lambda with receiver. Note that there is no
function analogous to `with2()` in the standard library, however, there are
similar extension functions taking ordinary lambdas, as explained in [Scope
Functions].
