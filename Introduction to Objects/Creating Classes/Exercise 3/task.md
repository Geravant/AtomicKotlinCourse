## Creating Classes (#1)

Create the `Robot` class with the following four member functions:
`goRight`, `goLeft`, `goDown` and `goUp`.
Each of these functions should take an integer `steps` as a parameter
and print one the following phrases to the console:

```
going right N steps
```

or 

```
going left N steps
```
and so on accordingly, where N is the provided number of steps.
