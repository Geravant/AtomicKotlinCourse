## Summary 2 (#1)

{{ :UNTESTABLE No names are given, no output or result is expected }}

Create three packages in three different files, but in the same directory.
Define a top-level function and a class in each file. Put `main()` in a fourth
file. Import the first package using the package name only (without additional
qualification), then access its function and class in `main()`. Import the
second package using a `*`, then access its function and class in `main()`.
Import the third package using fully-qualified names, then access its function
and class in `main()`.
