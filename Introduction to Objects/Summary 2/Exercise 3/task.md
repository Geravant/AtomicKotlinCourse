## Summary 2 (#3)

{{ :UNTESTABLE 'Show' can't be tested, no specific result is expected }}

Create a read-only `List` containing three `Boring` objects from the previous
exercise. Show that you can't add any more `Boring` objects to the `List`. Now
create an empty mutable `List` and add three `Boring` objects to the `List`.
