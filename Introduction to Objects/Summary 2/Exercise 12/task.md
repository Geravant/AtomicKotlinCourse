## Summary 2 (#4)

Create a class named `Boring2` which is just like `Boring` except it has
constructor arguments, which are all `val`s. The argument `a` holds the value
that `a()` produces, the argument `b` holds the value that `b()` produces, and
`c` holds the value produced by `c()`. Test `Boring2` using `atomictest`.
