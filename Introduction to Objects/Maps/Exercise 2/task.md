## Maps (#2)

The `Cage` class is designed to store hamsters. 
`Cage` has a fixed size, so you can't put a hamster in there if it's already full. 

For this task, hamsters are stored in a list.
In the next task, `Map` will be used instead of `List`.

Implement the `takeHamsterByName()` function that should find a hamster
by a given name and return it.
If there's no hamster with a given name, it should throw a `NoSuchElementException`.

Implement the `removeHamster()` function that should find a hamster
by a given name and remove it.
