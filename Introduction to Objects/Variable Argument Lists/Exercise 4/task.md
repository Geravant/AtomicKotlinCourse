## `vararg` Arguments (#2)

The reverse operation for the `chunked()` function used in the previous task is
called `flatten()`. This function is called on a list of lists and returns a
single list of all elements from the nested lists. Implement `flatten()`
without using the `flatten()` function from the standard library.
