## Variable Argument Lists (#5)

{{ :UNTESTABLE I'd rather remove this task. Since the students work mostly
with IntelliJ IDEA, we can explain here how to pass program arguments
using IntelliJ but I wouldn't ask them to install the command line compiler }}

Install the command-line version of Kotlin, then compile and test the examples
in the "Command-Line Arguments" section.
