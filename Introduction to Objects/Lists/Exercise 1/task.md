## Lists (#1)

The Kotlin standard library contains many functions that work with `Lists`.
It's educational to implement some of them by hand.

Write a function `findMax()` that finds the maximum value in a `List` of
natural numbers. If the `List` is empty, return zero. `findMax()` takes
`IntList` as a parameter---this is an example class defined in the solution
guide that only allows you to iterate over a `List`'s contents, get its size
and access elements by index.
