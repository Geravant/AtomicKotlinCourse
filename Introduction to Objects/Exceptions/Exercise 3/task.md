## Exceptions (#1)

Implement the function `repeatChar()` that returns a `String` consisting of a
character repeated a number of times specified by a function argument. The
function should throw an exception if the caller asks to repeat a character a
negative number of times.

Throw an exception with the message `"Count 'n' must be non-negative, but was xxx."`
where xxx should be replaced with the actual number.
