## Exceptions (#1)

{{ :UNTESTABLE Can't test "what happens" question, no specific results are expected }}

In `ToIntException.kt`, uncomment line **[1]** in `main()` to produce the
exception. Modify the program so the `Int` conversion is successful. What
happens if you put a floating-point number in as the `String` to be converted?
