## Property Accessors (#2)

{{ :UNTESTABLE and unsolvable: it's impossible to create a 'writeOnly' property }}

Create a class `Accessible` containing `String` properties `readWrite`,
`readOnly` and `writeOnly`. Add the appropriate property accessors to make each
property fit its name. Include `println()` statements to show that the
accessors are being called.
