## Summary 1 (#5)

{{ :UNTESTABLE I don't really understand what is expected here. What's more, 
since the previous function now has initial 'if' code, I don't see the necessity
in this one. }}

`String` results using a `String` template, substituting the values of the
parameters and showing the result by calculating an expression within the
template. Test them using the same arguments from the table above.
