## Summary 1 (#4)

This exercise continues experiments started in `Overflow.kt` to test `Long` and
`Double`. Implement `testLong()` to display the `Long` maximum value increased
by `1`. `testDouble()` should display the `Double` maximum value increased by
`1`. `testDouble2()` should display the result of comparing `Double.MAX_VALUE`
and `Double.MAX_VALUE + 1`.
