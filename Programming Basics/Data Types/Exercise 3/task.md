## Data Types (#3)

Attempt to combine the various `val`s defined in `Types.kt` using the `+`
operator. Only combine two at a time, and assign each combination to a `val`
result. Perform an exhaustive set of combinations (every identifier with every
other identifier), and see which types combine (if any do). Now add type
annotations to the new `val`s which successfully combine.
