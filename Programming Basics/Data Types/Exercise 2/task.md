## Data Types (#2)

Attempt to combine the various `val`s of different types using the `+`
operator. Only combine two at a time, and assign each combination to a `val`
result. See which types combine. Display to the console the name of the type
that can be combined with any other type if it goes first, and the name of the
type that can't be combined with itself using `+`.
