## Resource Cleanup (#1)

The starter code defines a `String` called `text`. Define a `writeAndRead()`
function that uses `java.io.File`. Create a `File` object initialized to
`"Soln1.txt"`. Delete the file if it exists. Then create it, and add `text` to
the file (IntelliJ IDEA will give you hints to help choose the member functions
to call for `File`). Use `useLines()` to read the file and display it with
`println()`, then use `forEachLine()` to read the file and display it with
`println()`. The starter code in `main()` tests `writeAndRead()`.
