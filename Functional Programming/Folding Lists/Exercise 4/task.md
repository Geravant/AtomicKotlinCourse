## Folding Lists (#4)

The starter code provides a `Condition` class and a function
`Condition.combine()` which combines two conditions. There's also a skeleton
for the `List<Condition>` extension function `combineAll()` which combines all
the conditions in the `List`. Complete the implementation using `reduce()`,
assuming the `List` is non-empty.
