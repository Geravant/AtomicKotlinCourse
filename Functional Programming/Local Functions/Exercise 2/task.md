## Local Functions (#2)

Demonstrate that you can put a local function inside a member function by
creating a class called `Fibonacci` with a member function `list(n: Int):
List<Int>`, where `n` indicates the quantity of Fibonacci numbers you want in
the result. Within `list()`, define a local function `next()` which produces
the next Fibonacci number.
