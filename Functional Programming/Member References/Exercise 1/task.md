## Member References (#1)

The starter code includes a `data` class called `Pet` containing a `var String`
property `name` and an `enum` property `habitat` which can be `land`, `water`
or `amphibious`.The `main()` starter code creates a `List<Pet>`. Using `any`
together with member references, write three expressions to discover whether
any pets in the list live on land, in the water, or are amphibious.
