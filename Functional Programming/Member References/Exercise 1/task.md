## Member References (#1)

The starter code includes a `data` class called `Pet` containing a `var String`
property `name`. The `main()` starter code creates a `Pet` instance called
`goldfish`. Create references to `name` and `toString()` for `goldfish`. Show
that you can modify `name` from your reference.
